Assets
======

Since Acrylamid â‰¥ 0.4 it is possible to include site specific files (also
known as assets) in your blog.  Acrylamid can either copy or compile files
from a number of directories.

To include assets, just add a bunch of directories to your :doc:`conf.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    STATIC = ['assets', 'static']

In addition all files from your theme are assets, too (except for HTML and XML
templates by default) and will be copied to the output directory.
